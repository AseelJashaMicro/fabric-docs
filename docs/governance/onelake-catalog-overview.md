# Discover and explore Fabric items in the OneLake catalog

OneLake catalog is a centralized place that helps you find, explore, and use the Fabric items you need, and govern the data you own. It features two tabs:

* **[Explore tab](./onelake-catalog-explore.md)**: The explore tab has an items list with an in-context item details view that makes it possible to browse through and explore items without losing your list context. It also provides selectors and filters to narrow down and focus the list, making it easier to find what you need.

* **[Govern tab](./onelake-catalog-govern.md)**: The govern tab provides insights that help you understand the governance posture of all the data you own in Fabric, and presents recommended actions you can take to improve the governance status of your data.

The OneLake catalog provides

* [A list of all Fabric items you have access to in your organization](#find-items-in-the-items-list).
* [An item details view that enables you to drill down on an item without leaving the catalog](#view-item-details).
* [Filters and selectors to help you find the content you're looking for](#filter-the-items-list).
* [A way to scoping the catalog to display only items of a particular domain](#scope-the-catalog-to-a-particular-domain).
* [An options menu for item actions](#open-an-items-options-menu)

This article explains what you see in the OneLake catalog and describes how to use it.
