## Considerations and limitations

* The Govern tab doesn't support business to business (B2B) scenarios.

Currently, the govern tab is not fully responsive to the domains filter of the OneLake catalog - only the insights are being filtered according to it - while the actions not, meaning that at this point, if the user filtered on domain X - the user will see insights related only to domain X but might see recommended actions related to items from domain Y - the fix to this issue is in progress
